## 1. Define Artificial Intelligence

**Objective**: Explain what Artificial Intelligence is and distinguish it from related fields like Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

**Success Criteria**: You can provide a clear definition of AI and explain the relationship between AI, ML, and DL using concrete examples.

## 2. Identify Types of AI Systems

**Objective**: Classify AI systems into categories (Narrow AI, General AI, Super AI) and provide examples of each.

**Success Criteria**: You can categorize real-world AI applications into the appropriate AI type and explain the differences between them.

## 3. Describe the History of AI

## How to Use These Objectives

These learning objectives are designed using **Bloom's Taxonomy** to ensure you develop both knowledge and critical thinking skills:

- **Remember**: Define, identify, describe
- **Understand**: Explain, classify, trace
- **Apply**: Demonstrate, implement (in the hands-on lab)
- **Analyze**: Evaluate, compare (in exercises)

As you progress through the chapter, refer back to these objectives to track your learning progress. Each section is designed to help you achieve these goals.
