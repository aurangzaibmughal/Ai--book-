# Quiz

Test your understanding of Chapter 1 concepts with this quiz. Try to answer without looking back at the chapter first!

## Multiple Choice Questions

### Question 1

What is the primary difference between Narrow AI and General AI?

A) Narrow AI is less powerful than General AI
B) Narrow AI is designed for specific tasks, while General AI can handle any intellectual task
C) Narrow AI uses neural networks, while General AI uses rule-based systems
D) Narrow AI is theoretical, while General AI exists today

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

Narrow AI (Weak AI) is designed to perform specific tasks within a limited context, while General AI (Strong AI) would have human-like intelligence capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across different domains. Most AI systems today are Narrow AI.

### Question 2

Which of the following is NOT a type of Machine Learning?

A) Supervised Learning
B) Unsupervised Learning
C) Reinforcement Learning
D) Deterministic Learning

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: D**

The three main types of Machine Learning are:
- Supervised Learning (learning from labeled data)
- Unsupervised Learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data)
- Reinforcement Learning (learning through trial and error)

"Deterministic Learning" is not a recognized ML category.

### Question 3

What is the relationship between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?

A) They are three separate, unrelated fields
B) Deep Learning ⊂ Machine Learning ⊂ AI
C) AI ⊂ Machine Learning ⊂ Deep Learning
D) Machine Learning and Deep Learning are the same thing

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which is a subset of AI:
- AI is the broadest concept (any technique for machine intelligence)
- Machine Learning is a subset of AI (learning from data)
- Deep Learning is a subset of ML (using multi-layer neural networks)

### Question 4

Which AI technique would be most appropriate for grouping customers into segments without predefined categories?

A) Supervised Learning
B) Unsupervised Learning
C) Reinforcement Learning
D) Transfer Learning

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

Unsupervised Learning is used when you want to find patterns or groupings in data without predefined labels or categories. Clustering algorithms (a type of unsupervised learning) are perfect for customer segmentation.

### Question 5

What is a key ethical concern in AI development?

A) AI systems are too expensive to develop
B) AI can perpetuate or amplify biases present in training data
C) AI requires too much electricity
D) AI is too difficult to understand

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: B**

Bias in AI is a major ethical concern. AI systems can perpetuate or amplify human biases present in training data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. This is particularly problematic in applications like hiring, lending, and criminal justice.

## True or False

### Question 6

**Statement**: Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: True**

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information.

</details>

---

### Question 7

**Statement**: All AI systems today are examples of General AI.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: False**

Almost all AI systems today are Narrow AI, designed for specific tasks. General AI (human-like intelligence across all domains) has not yet been achieved and remains a research goal.

</details>

---

### Question 8

**Statement**: Supervised learning requires labeled training data.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Answer: True**

Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data, where each example is paired with the correct output. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on these examples.

## Short Answer Questions

### Question 9

**Question**: Explain the difference between Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning in 2-3 sentences.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Sample Answer**:

Supervised Learning learns from labeled training data where the correct outputs are provided, making it suitable for tasks like classification and regression. Reinforcement Learning learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties, making it ideal for sequential decision-making tasks like game playing or robotics. The key difference is that supervised learning has explicit correct answers, while reinforcement learning discovers optimal behavior through exploration.

### Question 10

**Question**: Name three real-world applications of AI and identify which AI technique each primarily uses.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Sample Answer**:

1. **Netflix Recommendations** - Uses collaborative filtering and machine learning to suggest movies based on viewing history
2. **Self-Driving Cars** - Uses computer vision for object detection and reinforcement learning for navigation decisions
3. **Google Translate** - Uses natural language processing and deep learning (neural machine translation) to translate between languages
