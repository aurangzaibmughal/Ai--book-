# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

## Core Understanding

1. **Explain ROS 2 Architecture**
   - Describe the layered architecture of ROS 2
   - Understand the role of DDS middleware
   - Explain the differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2

2. **Master Communication Patterns**
   - Implement publish-subscribe communication with topics
   - Create and use services for request-response patterns
   - Understand actions for long-running tasks

3. **Configure Quality of Service (QoS)**
   - Select appropriate QoS policies for different scenarios
   - Understand reliability, durability, and history settings
   - Debug QoS compatibility issues

## Practical Skills

4. **Create ROS 2 Nodes**
   - Write nodes in Python and C++
   - Implement publishers and subscribers
   - Handle node lifecycle and shutdown

5. **Work with ROS 2 Tools**
   - Use command-line tools (ros2 node, ros2 topic, ros2 service)
   - Inspect running systems
   - Debug communication issues

6. **Understand Real-Time Capabilities**
   - Explain ROS 2's real-time features
   - Understand executor models
   - Configure for deterministic behavior

## Application

7. **Design Distributed Systems**
   - Architect multi-node robotic systems
   - Choose appropriate communication patterns
   - Handle network failures gracefully

8. **Integrate with Hardware**
   - Understand hardware abstraction layers
   - Connect sensors and actuators
   - Manage device drivers

## Assessment

You will demonstrate these objectives through:
- ✅ Hands-on lab: Creating a multi-node ROS 2 system
- ✅ Code examples: Publishers, subscribers, services, actions
- ✅ Exercises: Implementing communication patterns
- ✅ Quiz: Testing conceptual understanding
